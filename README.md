# burger-inserts

Burger Inserts is a project dedicated to help generating printable paper inserts that you can stick on deckboxes, or inside transparent deckboxes.

Current size includes Burger Token boxes.

Hosting at https://keyforge-burger-inserts.herokuapp.com has been discontinued.
Project is still available as open source if you want to build it and run it locally.

it has been converted to a rich application you can run locally. You can build it yourself or download the pre built one (link in https://github.com/drallieiv/keyforge-burger-inserts/releases)
Transition of MasterVault GhostGalaxy is still working exactly the same, but might require API subscription if you have intensive usage.
