# burger-inserts

Burger Inserts is a project dedicated to help generating printable paper inserts that you can stick on deckboxes, or inside transparent deckboxes.

Current size includes Burger Token boxes.

Hosting at https://keyforge-burger-inserts.herokuapp.com has been discontinued.
Project is still available as open source if you want to build it and run it locally.

Might work on converting it to a rich application you can run locally.
Future is also depending on the lifespan of MasterVault with the transition to GhostGalaxy

Reach me on discord at Drallieiv#4274 if you want to help contribute
